### Github Projects:
A project is an adaptable spreadsheet that integrates with your issues and pull requests on GitHub to help you plan and track your work effectively. You can create and customize multiple views by filtering, sorting, grouping your issues and pull requests, visualize work with configurable charts, and add custom fields to track metadata specific to your team.

### Repositories:
A repository contains all of your project's files and each file's revision history. You can discuss and manage your project's work within the repository.

### Create a repository:
* In the upper-right corner of any page, use the drop-down menu, and select New repository.
