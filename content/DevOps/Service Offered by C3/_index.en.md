## Server Monitoring

*Server monitoring is the process of tracking the performance, availability, and health of computer servers and related infrastructure to ensure they are functioning as expected. The primary goal of server monitoring is to proactively identify issues, prevent downtime, and optimize server performance. Here are some key aspects of server monitoring:*

**Metrics and Parameters:** 
Server monitoring involves collecting and analyzing various metrics and parameters. These can include CPU usage, memory usage, disk space, network activity, server response times, error rates, and more. These metrics help you understand how your server is performing.

**Alerting:** 
Monitoring systems often include alerting mechanisms. When certain metrics go beyond predefined thresholds the system can send alerts to administrators or operations teams. This allows for quick responses to potential issues.

**Uptime Monitoring:** 
This type of monitoring focuses on ensuring that servers and services are available and responsive. It checks for the accessibility of services and alerts when they are down or slow.

**Performance Monitoring:** 
Performance monitoring tracks the server's resource utilization, such as CPU and memory usage. It helps identify resource bottlenecks and potential performance issues.

**Log Analysis:** 
Server logs contain valuable information about what's happening on the server. Log analysis tools can help identify errors, security breaches, or unusual activities.

**Security Monitoring:** 
Monitoring for security breaches and unauthorized access attempts is crucial. This involves tracking login attempts, changes in security settings, and any suspicious activities.

**Capacity Planning:** 
Server monitoring can assist in capacity planning by providing historical data on resource usage. This helps in making informed decisions about when to upgrade hardware or scale infrastructure.

**Application Monitoring:** 
In addition to monitoring server resources, you can also monitor the performance and availability of specific applications or services running on the server. This is especially important for critical applications.

**Remote Monitoring:** 
Remote monitoring allows administrators to keep an eye on servers from anywhere. This can involve the use of remote monitoring tools like Grafana , Promotheus or cloud-based services.

**Historical Data Analysis:** 

Monitoring systems often store historical data, which can be useful for trend analysis and identifying long-term issues or areas for improvement.

*Server monitoring can be done using a variety of tools and software, ranging from open-source solutions to commercial products. Some well-known server monitoring tools include Nagios, Zabbix, Prometheus, and commercial solutions like SolarWinds and New Relic. The choice of tool depends on the specific needs and budget of your organization.*

> Effective server monitoring is a critical part of ensuring the reliability and performance of your IT infrastructure, particularly in larger organizations where numerous servers and services need to be managed.

## Jenkins

Jenkins is an open-source automation server used for building, deploying, and automating software development processes. It is a widely used and highly extensible tool that helps development and operations teams streamline their continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipelines. 

## Sonar Reports


SonarQube (formerly known as Sonar) is an open-source platform for continuous inspection of code quality. It performs static code analysis on source code to identify and report on a wide range of code quality and security issues. SonarQube generates detailed reports, often referred to as "Sonar reports," which provide insights into the quality of your codebase and help you improve it. 


## Synk Reports

Snyk is a popular security platform that specializes in identifying and addressing security vulnerabilities in open-source libraries and container images. It helps developers and organizations ensure the security of their software by continuously monitoring and analyzing their dependencies for known vulnerabilities.
