 We need continuous monitoring because:
 
 1. Better network visibility & transparency

2. Facilitates rapid responses 

3. Minimize system downtime

 4. Assists with healthy business performance

 Continuous control monitoring is a automated process which devops person (or)anyone can observe and detect compliance issues and security threats during each phase of the devops pipeline.

## Grafana

It is a multi-platform open source analytics and interactive visualization web application.that allow you to analyze and display data from various sources in real time.it provides a powerful and flexible way to create interactive dashboards,graphs,charts for monitoring and analyzing metrics,logs,other time series data.

## Prometheus

It is a open source system monitoring and alerting tool which pull the metric from client server over http and place the data in to its local data base which works on the principle of time series data base.

>Prometheus only can pull (or) scrapes data canâ€™t collect the data by its own.so we uses some tools to collect the data.

## Pushgateway

Prometheus scrapes data from applications and services at regular intervals, but the job intervals are still too slow to capture valuable information for batch jobs which complete so quickly that their lifespans are shorter than the Prometheus scrape interval itself, making it impossible to capture metrics from them at runtime.

Prometheus Pushgateway is a component of Prometheus that helps collect metrics for extremely small jobs. Instead of waiting until the next Prometheus scrape interval, which may slow down the system, we choose to have these brief jobs push metrics to a Pushgateway. A Prometheus Pushgateway acts as a kind of intermediate gateway, storing these pushed metrics until the next scrape interval.

- The --persistence.file flag sets the file location where to pushing metrics.
- The Pushgateway exposes all pushed metrics via the /metrics endpoint. this can changed this with the --web.telemetry-path flag.

- By default, Pushgateway listens to port 9091. 

## Alerts

Alert actively monitor your metric data and trigger notification or actions based on predefined conditions. alerts are more proactive and can help you detect and respond to critical events or anomalies in your data.

## Thresholds

threshold in grafana refer to predefined boundaries or limits set on metric. they are used to visually highlight (or) mask specific ranges (or) values in your data.

Thresholds helps your quickly identify when a metric exceeds (or) falls below a certain threshold level.

> Thresholds provide a visual aid but do not trigger any notification or actions on their own.

## Prometheus Metrics

A Metric is a Quantative measure that helps in the assessment ,comparison,and tracking of operational statistics.

Prometheus collects as a timestamped set of changes recorded successively in fixed intervals.
This metric data is then exposed by prometheus using a combination of the metric names and labels.

## Exporter

These are Software components that Facilitate the collection of metrics from different systems and applications.

These exporters are deployed alongside the target system and provide an interface for metrics retrieval.
