 **Promotheus**

It is a open source system monitoring and alerting tool which pull the metric from client server over http and place the data in to its local data base which works on the principle of time series data base.

>Prometheus only can pull (or) scrapes data canâ€™t collect the data by its own.so we uses some tools to collect the data.

**Prometheus Features**:

Prometheus's main features are:

- A multi-dimensional data model with time series data identified by metric name and key/value pairs
- PromQL, a flexible query language to leverage this dimensionality
- No reliance on distributed storage; single server nodes are autonomous
- time series collection happens via a pull model over HTTP
- Pushing time series is supported via an intermediary gateway
- Targets are discovered via service discovery or static configuration
- Multiple modes of graphing and dashboarding support

```

 Create a user prometheus and assign it to the created prometheus group.

```
$ sudo useradd -s /sbin/nologin --system -g prometheus prometheus
```

 Set the ownership of Prometheus files and data directories to the prometheus group and user.

```
$ sudo chown -R prometheus:prometheus /etc/prometheus/  /var/lib/prometheus/
```
```
$ sudo chmod -R 775 /etc/prometheus/ /var/lib/prometheus/
```
## Configure Systemd Service

```
$ sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/prometheus.service
```
 Add the following lines to the file and save it:
```
[Unit]
Description=Prometheus
Wants=network-online.target
After=network-online.target

[Service]
User=prometheus
Group=prometheus
Restart=always
Type=simple
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/prometheus \
    --config.file=/etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml \
    --storage.tsdb.path=/var/lib/prometheus/ \
    --web.console.templates=/etc/prometheus/consoles \
    --web.console.libraries=/etc/prometheus/console_libraries \
    --web.listen-address=0.0.0.0:9090

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```
