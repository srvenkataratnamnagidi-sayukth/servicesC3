# GramSevak Product Documentation
Documentation is an important part of Software Engineering. 
It is a viable part of Software Development process and without it, it is hard to maintain any project and the developers have to re-invent the wheel.
1. For a programmer reliable documentation is always a must.
1. The presence of documentation helps keep track of all aspects of an application and it improves on the quality of a software product. Its main focuses are development,maintenance and knowledge transfer to other developers. Successful documentation will make information easily accessible, provide a limited number of user entry points, help new users learn quickly, simplify the product and help cut support costs.
1.  Documentation is usually focused on the following components that make up an application
	1. **Server environments** \
		Detailed documentation about an application and its environments is always a must. This information will help with setting up new environments for your application and it should present the location and function of the systems that run your services. Things that should be specified here are the application name/version, server name, IP, code directory, URL to the application, operating system, user account information and a point of contact.
	1. **Business rules** \
		Business rules documentation help new additions to the team adapt faster to the working habits of the company. It provides information on how the product works and why. Business rules documentation can easily be supported with requirements documents if available. This will speed up a developer's learning curve significantly. In addition to business rules, a help document, FAQs, or user guide can help highlight the main points of an application for a developer who needs context for the application they are supporting.
	1. **Databases/files** \
		Database information is mandatory for porting, reverting, sharding, migrating and so on. It is important to know the type of database, the server information, the version but most importantly to have a data model diagram. Documentation of the database will make bringing additions to the table, modifications to the structure and types, additions of indexes and keys much more simpler and easier to control/debug. Also, if an application presents a file transfer functionality, it is recommended to document which way the transfer is made, through which protocol and datatypes, if and what SSL certificates are needed.
	1. **Troubleshooting** \
		The troubleshooting documentation helps when running into production issues. Most technical issues should have error codes that should help with troubleshooting. In this document there should also be included an FAQ section to deal with general or usual problems (such as configuration issues). The errors should be documented split by type of error, module where it comes from, and level of error (exception, warning, critical, etc...).
	1. **Application installation** \
		Installation and configuration documents are useful for when developers need to set up new or additional application environments. If possible, the steps should be detailed and easy to follow and can include screenshots if necessary. Anyone should be able to follow the steps and successfully install an application. Having the steps identified will help the installer prevent problems because of missing parts of an application. Details such as necessary software, libraries, and application server versions, can be included to ensure the environment will be compatible and set up as intended.
	1. **Code deployment** \
		The code documentation is the backbone of every application. Code documentation can be split in multiple parts. The first one, the most helpful for programmers are the comment blocks. These will be found through every file explaining classes, methods, parameters, possible errors. Then comes the specific file documentations. These are usually generated through a third party script which will parse a file and, based on the comment blocks, will create an explicit PDF. Afterwards there should be information regarding the code repository, where the file updates are found, and where they need to be moved. In addition, there should be step-by-step instructions on how to create an application package or a build to be deployed.

## Importance of Software Documentation
1. **Clarify your business goals, requirements and activities** With a proper documentation, you can share the business goals and requirement with your managers and team mates so that they have a clear vision and goals and the activity they perform will be more towards the success.
1. **Design and Specify your product** This comes in Architectural/Design documents and it gives you complete overview of how your products look like.
1. **Everything is clearly explained** When you makes End User documentation of the product of software, you have to explain each and everything about its working. It describes each feature of the program, and assists the user in realizing these features.
1. **Any body can work on otherâ€™s code** If you are a developer, it is not sufficient to write good codes only but you also need to take cares about the documentation part, which can be helpful to other developers while working in a team.
1. **Helpful in proper communication** A good software documentation is helpful in proper communication. The written procedure helps you to make interaction within several departments.

Documentation may be in the form of time records, daily reports by a project manager, schedules, photographs, videos, correspondence either by a letter or an email or a fax, filing or by information logs. The importance of documentation is so tremendous, many project managers are now terming it their top priority while managing any kind of work.
+ Documentation is the best, and sometimes the only way you can keep a record of the work done, the strategies used, the changes that occurred and all the little specifics an average human mind is capable of forgetting. Knowing the history of the project is essential for the current plan of action as well as how you proceed in the future.
+ Your clients want answers all the time. So does your team and your own boss! Last but not the least and very importantly so, you yourself need answers too. Documentation helps you deal with all these queries.
+ While carrying out a project, you may need to document every other thing to protect your own self from being accused falsely. People tend to blame project managers for whatever goes wrong. Documentation in the form of letters, emails, photographs or schedules is proof that protects you from lawsuits or other complications later on.
+ Documentation is evidence of a good project management. It helps you track activities related to the project, find out if time constraints are being met, monitor productivity and plan for the future. A good project manager will never leave any loose ends to his project.
+ By carrying out this important task, the project manager and the stakeholders are all expecting the same outcomes. There are no unpleasant surprises and no unknown risks.
Conflicts, disagreements and problems amongst all parties seldom arise. When all aspects of the project are right in front of everyone, it leaves little room for argument.
+ Documentation also helps every individual member involved to have complete knowledge of their responsibilities, have a clear idea of what is expected from them and how they need to manage their work.
+ If the correct record keeping protocol is followed, it gives the project manager complete control over the project by being the best source of knowledge for the entire team.
