If you have even a little bit of business experience, you've probably already implemented strategic business initiatives, even if you didn't call them that. For example, because technology changes at a rapid pace, many businesses find themselves implementing new software every few years to improve the efficiency of their workflows. Overhauling your business's tech system certainly merits a strategic plan, a budget, and a start and end date, transforming it from a mere goal to a full-blown business initiative.

Some business initiatives could affect the entire company, but many can be launched within a specific department. For example, ClearPoint Strategy outlines marketing initiatives like cross-selling more items, remarketing to existing customers, lowering cart abandonment rates or increasing email signups. Meanwhile, the shipping department could focus on improving warehouse efficiency, reducing the number of accidents or injuries, or reducing packaging costs. The financing department could be tasked with researching additional revenue streams or auditing internal spending to find opportunities to cut costs.

Even if you're already following your industry's best practices, there's almost always room for innovation and improvement. You can develop initiatives aimed at growing your company's market share, improving customer satisfaction, or expanding to more locations. Ultimately, all business initiatives are implemented with the intention of affecting revenue or profit, so it can be helpful to not only ask, for example, "How can we improve customer satisfaction?" but also, "How will improved customer satisfaction affect our finances"?
