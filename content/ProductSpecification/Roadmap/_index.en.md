A strategy roadmap describes the **what** and the **why**. An execution plan describes the **how**.

A strategy roadmap is not a visual Gantt chart of activities with start dates and end dates. It describes what the organization must **change**, and why the changes are required, in order to achieve the strategic vision.

An execution plan describes how the organization will deliver the **outcomes** described in the strategy roadmap. Often, an execution plan is represented in a Gantt chart with a specific timeframe, start and end dates, milestones, and resource allocation.

An execution plan is derived by gathering groups of people into a workshop, Initiatives & Hackathons handing out some sticky notes and start spawning a list of initiatives. The workshop is usually facilitated with the key question being: ‘What initiatives or activities do we need to execute?’ From there, the people in the room simply dream up a list.
