      <description>A hackathon (also known as a hack day, hackfest or codefest; a portmanteau of hacking marathon) is a design sprint-like event; often, in which computer programmers and others involved in software development, including graphic designers, interface designers, project managers, domain experts, and others collaborate intensively on software projects.
The goal of a hackathon is to create functioning software or hardware by the end of the event.[1] Hackathons tend to have a specific focus, which can include the programming language used, the operating system, an application, an API, or the subject and the demographic group of the programmers.</description>

      <description>If you have even a little bit of business experience, you&amp;rsquo;ve probably already implemented strategic business initiatives, even if you didn&amp;rsquo;t call them that. For example, because technology changes at a rapid pace, many businesses find themselves implementing new software every few years to improve the efficiency of their workflows. Overhauling your business&amp;rsquo;s tech system certainly merits a strategic plan, a budget, and a start and end date, transforming it from a mere goal to a full-blown business initiative.</description>
